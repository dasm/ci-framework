## Background

### Current Challenges

Based on the CI tooling team discussion on September 17, 2025, the current workflow presents several challenges:

#### Workflow and Stability Disruptions

‚Ä¢ **Daily Sync Instability**: The main branch currently syncs daily changes to the stable CI framework branch. This process causes frequent disruption and instability for users. Users complain about constant changes that distrupt their current workflows.

‚Ä¢ **Lack of Versioning**: A significant challenge is the lack of project versioning and the practice of pushing changes directly to the main branch. This makes it difficult for end users to easily understand changes or decide when to update their jobs.

‚Ä¢ **Predictability Issues**: The lack of a defined release cadence means there is no advance versioning or defined release time between main and stable branches. Consequently, users face unpredictable breaking changes.

#### Deprecation and Development Problems

‚Ä¢ **Issues with Deprecation**: The current process creates problems when trying to deprecate and remove playbooks from the CI framework. Confusion was expressed regarding how a new release cadence would even assist with playbook deprecation.

‚Ä¢ **Long-Term Project Submission**: The existing structure causes issues when submitting Pull Requests (PRs) for long-term development changes.

‚Ä¢ **Conflicting Goals ("Chicken and Egg Problem")**: There is a "chicken and egg problem" of wanting to release breaking changes while simultaneously keeping customers undisrupted. This is exacerbated by the difficulty downstream teams have with long-term planning because they cannot rely on stable component availability.

#### User Compliance and Implementation Concerns

‚Ä¢ **Ensuring Updates**: A challenge lies in ensuring all downstream CI jobs update to the designated stable branch or new tags.

‚Ä¢ **Communication Gaps**: Breaking changes surprise downstream consumers because of communication gaps and the lack of advance notice for deprecated components.

‚Ä¢ **Overhead Concerns**: Concerns were raised regarding the potential overhead and complexity of implementing a new structured system, such as a tagging system.

The proposed solution to these issues involves adopting a stable branch and tags approach, with a predictable bi-weekly release cadence.

### Team Consensus

The team agreed on the following principles:
- **Stable branch + tagging approach** over complex branching strategies
- **2-week release cycle** for predictable cadence with CalVer versioning
- **6-release minimum deprecation timeline** (12 weeks notice)
- **Automation-first enforcement** to reduce manual overhead

## Release Cadence Solution

### Overview

```
Development Flow:
main branch (development) ‚Üí stable branch (auto-promoted when criteria met) ‚Üí tagged releases (scheduled)
```

### Current State
- **Stable branch automation**: Already exists - automatically updates when validation criteria are met
- **Missing component**: Scheduled tagging process for predictable releases
- **Goal**: Implement bi-weekly tagging of stable branch for consumption

### Release Schedule

- **Frequency**: Every 2 weeks (bi-weekly)
- **Release Cycle**: 2 weeks
- **Release Day**: Tuesday of even-numbered weeks
- **Emergency Releases**: Hot-fix tags as needed

### Versioning Scheme

**Format:** `YYYY.WW.PATCH` (CalVer - Calendar Versioning)

- **YYYY**: Year
- **WW**: ISO week number (01-53 annually)
- **PATCH**: Hot-fix increment

**Examples:**
- `2025.42.0` - Week 42, 2025 release
- `2025.42.1` - Hot-fix for Week 42 release
- `2025.44.0` - Next release (2 weeks later)

### Release Process

#### Week 1: Active Development
- All development on `main` branch
- Continuous integration testing
- Feature development and bug fixes
- Stable branch automatically updates when criteria are met

#### Week 2: Release Tagging
- **Monday-Wednesday**: Continue development, the stable branch continues its auto-updates
- **Monday**: Evaluate current stable branch commit for release tagging
- **Tuesday**: Create release tag from stable branch, send release communication

#### Stable Branch Automation (Ongoing)
- **Automatic promotion**: Main ‚Üí stable when validation criteria are met
- **No manual intervention**: Process runs continuously based on CI results
- **Release readiness**: Stable branch is always in a releasable state

### Tagging Process (To Be Implemented)

#### Release Tag Creation
```bash
# Automated script for bi-weekly releases
./scripts/create-release-tag

# Dry run to see what would happen
./scripts/create-release-tag --dry-run

# Force tagging even if stable branch is stale
FORCE=true ./scripts/create-release-tag
```

#### Tag Selection Criteria
- **Source**: Current HEAD of stable branch (automatically promoted)
- **Timing**: Every Tuesday at 15:00 UTC via automation
- **Validation**:
  - Verify stable branch has recent commits (within last 2 weeks)
  - Ensure stable branch passed all promotion criteria
  - Ensure there are no duplicate tags
- **Naming**: Follow CalVer format `YYYY.WW.PATCH`

#### Hot-fix Tags
- **Trigger**: Critical issues in current release
- **Process**: Cherry-pick fix to stable, create patch release
- **Example**: `2025.42.1` for hot-fix of `2025.42.0`
- **Automation**: Patch increment handled by `create-release-tag` script

### Branch Strategy

| Branch | Purpose | Update Frequency | Consumer Usage |
|--------|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| `main` | Active development | Continuous | CI Framework developers only |
| `stable` | Tested, ready for consumption | Automatic (when criteria met) | Available for consumption |
| Tags | Fixed release points | Every 2 weeks (Tuesday) | Required for production jobs |

## Deprecation Process

## Enforcement Strategy

### Technical Enforcement

#### 1. Commit Validation

**Mature Python-Based Tools from [conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/about/#tooling-for-conventional-commits):**
- **Gitlint**: Python-based conventional commits linter
  - Install: `pip install -r test-requirements.txt` (includes gitlint==0.19.1)
  - Config: `.gitlint` configuration file included
  - Usage: Automatic via pre-commit hooks

- **Commitizen**: Python conventional commits workflow tool
  - Install: `pip install -r test-requirements.txt` (includes commitizen==3.29.0)
  - Usage: `cz commit` for interactive commit creation
  - Supports: Auto-changelog generation and version bumping

- **Pre-commit**: Essential for automated validation
  - Install: `pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`
  - Benefits: Battle-tested, community maintained, comprehensive features

**CI Framework Integration:**
- **Conventional Commits**: Handled entirely by gitlint via pre-commit hooks
- **Deprecation Compliance**: `scripts/check-deprecation.py` (CI Framework specific rules only)
- **Pre-commit Config**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (clean separation: gitlint + CI Framework specific tools)

#### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Gates
- **GitHub Actions**: Perform deprecation compliance checks on PRs
- **Zuul Integration**: Automated validation for OpenStack CI
- **Failure Conditions**: Will fail if missing migration docs or the timeline is insufficient

#### 3. Developer Tools

##### Deprecation Helper CLI
```bash
# Interactive deprecation workflow
./scripts/cifmw-deprecate --interactive

# Non-interactive usage
./scripts/cifmw-deprecate --component "playbooks/old.yml" \
  --type playbook --reason "Performance issues" \
  --alternative "playbooks/new.yml"
```

##### Status Dashboard
```bash
# View current deprecation status
./scripts/deprecation-status.py

# Export JSON report
./scripts/deprecation-status.py --export report.json
```

##### Conventional Commits Validation (Recommended Tools)
```bash
# Using Pre-commit (Recommended)
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Using Gitlint
pip install -r test-requirements.txt  # Includes gitlint + commitizen
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg

# Validate commit messages
gitlint --msg-filename path/to/commit-message.txt
gitlint lint --commits HEAD~5..HEAD  # Validate commit range

# Interactive commit creation with Commitizen
cz commit
```

### Process Enforcement

#### 1. Pull Request Templates
- Mandatory checklists for breaking changes
- Deprecation compliance verification
- Migration documentation requirements

#### 2. Code Review Standards
- Minimum 2 reviewers for deprecations
- Team lead approval for major changes
- Mandatory migration guide review

#### 3. Automated Monitoring
- Weekly compliance reports
- Slack/Teams alerts for violations
- Compliance threshold enforcement (85% minimum)

### Developer Experience

#### 1. Developer Setup & VS Code Integration

**Setup (Python only, no npm required):**
```bash
# Install and setup pre-commit (uses existing .pre-commit-config.yaml)
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Test validation
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"
```

**VS Code Integration:**
- **Conventional Commit Snippets**: `.vscode/conventional-commits.code-snippets`
  - `ccfeat` - Feature commits
  - `ccfix` - Bug fix commits
  - `ccdeprecate` - Deprecation commits
  - `ccremove` - Removal commits
  - `depwarn` - Deprecation warnings for YAML files
- **Auto-completion**: Migration guide paths, component references

#### 2. Commit Validation Rules & Examples

**Conventional Commits Standard:**
- **Format**: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
- **Types**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
- **Breaking changes**: Use `!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
- **Length**: Subject ‚â§ 72 chars, body lines ‚â§ 100 chars

**CI Framework Extensions:**
- **Deprecation commits** must reference migration docs
- **Removal commits** should specify target version (CalVer format)
- **Ansible changes** should include component paths
- **Breaking changes** need detailed descriptions

**Examples:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good conventional commits
feat: add user authentication
fix(roles): correct variable name in deploy_bmh
feat!: deprecate legacy playbook xyz

BREAKING CHANGE: legacy playbook xyz removed, use abc instead
See: docs/migration/playbook-xyz.md

# ‚ùå Bad commits (will be rejected)
add some stuff
WIP: testing things
Update files
```

**Troubleshooting:**
```bash
# Fix formatting issues
echo "your message" | npx commitlint

# Generate proper templates
./scripts/cifmw-deprecate --interactive

# Skip validation (emergency only)
git commit --no-verify -m "hotfix: critical security patch"
```
